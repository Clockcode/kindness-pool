# Critical Security Issues (Most Urgent)
- [x] Add reentrancy protection to distributePool function
  - Implemented checks-effects-interactions pattern
- [x] Check if it's possible for users to do denial of service attacks and how to prevent them
  - Implemented rate limiting and transaction limiting
- [x] The distributePool function should be restricted to authorized addresses (like an admin or a time-based contract).
- [x] Add zero address checks in constructors

# Core Functionality (High Priority)
- [x] Implement amount limits (0.001 to 1 ETH) in giveKindness function
- [x] Add check to prevent users who have contributed from entering receiver pool
- [x] Move isInRecieverPool to UserRegistry
- [x] Implement mechanism to handle failed transfers in distributePool
  - Added robust tracking of failed receivers
  - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Added emergency withdrawal handling for stuck funds
- [x] Add checks for contract balance before distribution
  - Implemented balance verification in distributePool
  - Added minimum pool balance constant
- [x] Add tracking for daily contributions to enforce giver/receiver rules
  - Implemented daily reset mechanism using day counter
  - Added daily contribution limits (5 ETH max per day)
  - Added daily receiver pool entry limits (1 entry per day)
  - Added lazy reset mechanism for gas efficiency
  - Added helper functions for daily stats and limits
- [x] Set the rule that user can only enter and leave receiver pool once in a day
  - Added daily entry/exit tracking with separate counters
  - Implemented 30-minute cooldown period between receiver pool actions
  - Added emergency exit mechanism for administrators
  - Added leaveReceiverPool function for users
  - Updated daily stats to include exit tracking

# Best Practices & Documentation (Medium Priority)
- [x] Set Prettier solidity plugin to format the code
  - Added .prettierrc configuration with Solidity-specific formatting rules
  - Added format and format:check scripts to package.json
  - Formatted existing contracts with new configuration
- [x] Use custom errors instead of require statements
- [x] Add NatSpec documentation for all functions
- [x] Add input validation for constructor parameters
- [x] Add events for important state changes
- [x] Add events for failed transfers and redistributions

# Testing & Additional Features (Lower Priority)
- [x] Add tests for denial of service attacks
  - Added comprehensive DoS attack resistance tests
  - Added gas limit tests for receiver pool size and failed transfers
  - Added transaction limit tests for daily limits and reset mechanisms
  - Added rate limit tests for cooldown periods and daily limits
  - Added resource exhaustion tests for failed transfer handling
  - Documented transaction count reset bug in daily mechanism
- [x] Add tests for failed transfer handling
- [x] Add documentation for the new functionality
  - Updated README.md with comprehensive setup instructions, API overview, and deployment guide
  - Added detailed API.md with complete contract documentation, function references, and integration examples
  - Added DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step deployment instructions for all networks
  - Included security considerations, troubleshooting guides, and best practices
  - Documented new functionality including DoS protection, daily limits, and failed transfer handling
- [x] Implement withdrawal functionality for users who want to withdraw their contribution
  - Added withdrawContribution function allowing users to withdraw same-day contributions
  - Implemented withdrawal limits: 3 withdrawals per day, 2-hour cooldown between withdrawals
  - Added minimum withdrawal amount (0.001 ETH) and comprehensive validation
  - Added withdrawal tracking with automatic daily reset mechanism
  - Included comprehensive view functions for withdrawal status and limits
  - Added comprehensive test suite covering all withdrawal scenarios
