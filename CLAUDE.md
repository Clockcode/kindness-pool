# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Hardhat-based Solidity project implementing a decentralized kindness pool system. Users can contribute ETH to or receive from a daily pool, with 24-hour cycles for contributions and distributions. The system includes comprehensive security features, rate limiting, and DoS protection.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

The system consists of 4 main smart contracts:

### Contract Hierarchy
- **Pool.sol** - Main contract managing contributions, receivers, and distributions
- **UserRegistry.sol** - Manages user statistics and receiver pool status  
- **TimeBasedDistributor.sol** - Handles time-based distribution logic
- **Errors.sol** - Custom error definitions for gas-efficient error handling
- **TestReceiver.sol** - Testing utility for failed transfer scenarios

### Key Design Patterns
- Uses OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for role-based permissions
- Implements checks-effects-interactions pattern for reentrancy protection
- Immutable UserRegistry reference in Pool contract for gas optimization
- Custom errors instead of require strings for gas efficiency
- Failed transfer tracking with retry mechanisms

## ‚ú® Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Daily Contribution System** - Users can contribute 0.001-1 ETH per transaction
- ‚úÖ **Receiver Pool Management** - Users can enter/exit receiver pool (max 100 receivers)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Daily Reset** - 24-hour cycles with automatic state reset
- ‚úÖ **Equal Distribution** - Pool funds distributed equally among all receivers

### Security & Rate Limiting
- ‚úÖ **Action Cooldowns** - 1 hour general, 30 minutes receiver pool actions
- ‚úÖ **Daily Limits** - 5 ETH max contribution, 10 transactions per user per day
- ‚úÖ **DoS Protection** - Max 100 receivers, gas limit considerations
- ‚úÖ **Reentrancy Protection** - Checks-effects-interactions pattern
- ‚úÖ **Access Control** - Role-based permissions for admin functions

### Advanced Features
- ‚úÖ **Batch Distribution** - Prevents gas limit issues with large receiver pools
- ‚úÖ **Failed Transfer Handling** - Tracking and retry mechanism for failed transfers

- ‚úÖ **Withdrawal Functionality** - Users can withdraw their contributions
- ‚úÖ **User Statistics Tracking** - Comprehensive user interaction history
- ‚úÖ **Emergency Functions** - Admin controls for system management

### Business Logic Constraints
- ‚úÖ **Mutual Exclusivity** - Users cannot contribute AND be in receiver pool same day
- ‚úÖ **Contribution Validation** - Minimum 0.001 ETH, maximum 1 ETH per transaction
- ‚úÖ **Receiver Pool Limits** - Maximum 100 receivers to prevent gas issues
- ‚úÖ **Time-based Controls** - 24-hour cycles with proper state management

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Transaction Count Reset Bug**: `transactionCount` mapping not reset in daily reset, causing permanent lockout after 10 transactions
2. **Gas Limit Risk**: Large receiver pools may approach gas limits during distribution (partially mitigated by batch processing)

### Resolved Issues
- ‚úÖ Failed transfer handling (resolved with retry system)
- ‚úÖ Gas limit issues (resolved with batch distribution)
- ‚úÖ DoS attack vulnerabilities (resolved with comprehensive protection)

## üéØ Business Logic Constraints

### Daily Cycle System
- 24-hour cycles with automatic reset mechanism
- Users can contribute (0.001-1 ETH per transaction) OR enter receiver pool, not both
- Distribution occurs at end of cycle to all receivers equally
- Failed transfers are tracked and can be retried

### Critical Limits (Hardcoded Constants)
```solidity
MIN_KINDNESS_AMOUNT: 0.001 ETH           // Minimum contribution
MAX_KINDNESS_AMOUNT: 1 ETH               // Maximum per transaction
MAX_DAILY_CONTRIBUTION: 5 ETH            // Maximum per user per day
MAX_RECEIVERS: 100                       // Total receiver pool limit
MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_DAY: 10             // Per user daily transaction limit
ACTION_COOLDOWN: 1 hour                  // General action cooldown
RECEIVER_POOL_COOLDOWN: 30 minutes       // Receiver pool action cooldown
```

## üéØ AI Development Guidelines

### Architecture & Design Principles

#### Smart Contract Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each contract should have one clear purpose
- **Immutable References**: Use immutable variables for contract addresses to save gas
- **Custom Errors**: Always use custom errors instead of require strings for gas efficiency
- **Events First**: Emit events for all state changes to enable frontend integration
- **Access Control**: Use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for role-based permissions
- **Upgradability**: Consider proxy patterns only when absolutely necessary, prefer immutable designs

#### Security First Approach
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Always follow this pattern to prevent reentrancy
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at function entry points
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement cooldowns and daily limits for user actions
- **DoS Protection**: Consider gas limits and implement batching for large operations
- **Emergency Controls**: Include pause/emergency functions for critical scenarios
- **Failed Transfer Handling**: Always handle failed ETH transfers gracefully

#### Gas Optimization Strategies
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations to reduce transaction costs
- **Storage Optimization**: Pack structs and use appropriate data types
- **View Functions**: Use view/pure functions for read operations
- **Event Indexing**: Index important event parameters for efficient querying
- **Loop Limits**: Implement maximum iteration limits to prevent gas limit issues

### Testing Excellence Standards

#### Test Architecture
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all functions, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and use fresh contract deployments
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with realistic user interaction patterns
- **Gas Tracking**: Monitor gas usage for optimization opportunities
- **Security Testing**: Include specific tests for DoS attacks and security vulnerabilities

#### Test Organization
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- **Setup Patterns**: Use consistent beforeEach patterns for contract deployment
- **Helper Functions**: Create reusable helper functions for common test operations
- **Error Testing**: Test both success and failure paths for all functions
- **State Verification**: Always verify contract state after operations

#### Test Coverage Areas
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-contract interactions
- **User Journey Tests**: Complete end-to-end user flows
- **Security Tests**: Attack vectors and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Gas usage and efficiency

5. **Document the Fix**: Explain the fix in commit messages and comments

#### When Optimizing
1. **Measure First**: Use gas profiling to identify bottlenecks
2. **Benchmark**: Compare before and after performance
3. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure optimizations don't change behavior
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify optimizations don't introduce bugs
5. **Document Changes**: Explain optimization techniques used
